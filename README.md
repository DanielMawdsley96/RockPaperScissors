# RockPaperScissors
Collection of pyhton scripts which play the game of rock, paper scissors. In verisons in the beta the computer ai is designed to beat the opponent using information from a study on rock paper scissors. 

Introduction:

The aim of this project was to develop a rock paper scissors game wherby the computer was able to beat the player more than it lost.
This was acheived thanks to the effort of my poor family who had to play this game 100's of times to test if it worked.
The results from testing 400 games from 2 family members where as follows:

Computer - 166
Player - 119 
Draws - 115 

For more information on the testing feel free to reading the testing section.
